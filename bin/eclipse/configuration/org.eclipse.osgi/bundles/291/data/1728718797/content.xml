Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor&#xA;be&#xA;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising&#xA;as a&#xA;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use&#xA;the&#xA;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;9.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;   License.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of&#xA;   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,&#xA;   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable&#xA;   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,&#xA;   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,&#xA;   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable&#xA;   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their&#xA;   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)&#xA;   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You&#xA;   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;   as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;4.

The contents&#xA;       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&#xA;       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&#xA;       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;       as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;   the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&#xA;   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#xA;   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&#xA;   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#xA;   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#xA;   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

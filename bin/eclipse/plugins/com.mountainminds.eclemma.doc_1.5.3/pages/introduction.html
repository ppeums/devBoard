<h1>EclEmma Java Code Coverage Tool</h1>

<p>
  EclEmma is a free Java code coverage tool for Eclipse, available under the 
  <a href="license.html">Eclipse Public License</a>. Internally it is based on
  the great <a href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</a> Java code coverage
  tool, trying to adopt EMMA's philosophy for the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fast develop/test cycle:</b> Launches from within the workbench like
    JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.</li>
  <li><b>Rich coverage analysis:</b> Coverage results are immediately summarized
    and highlighted in the Java source code editors.
  </li>
  <li><b>Non-invasive:</b> EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or
  performing any other setup.</li>
 </ul>

<p>
  The Eclipse integration has its focus on supporting the individual developer
  in an highly interactive way. Please refer to Emma's command line tools and
  Ant tasks for automated test runs and report generation for teams.
</p>

<h2>Feature Overview</h2>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p>
  EclEmma adds a so called <i>launch mode</i> to the Eclipse workbench. It is
  called <i>Coverage</i> mode and works exactly like the existing <i>Run</i> and
  <i>Debug</i> modes. The <i>Coverage</i> launch mode can be activated from the
  <i>Run</i> menu or the workbench's toolbar:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  Simply launch your applications or unit tests in the <i>Coverage</i> mode to
  collect coverage information. Currently the following launch types are
  supported:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Java application</li>
  <li>Eclipse/RCP application</li>
  <li>JUnit test</li>
  <li>JUnit plug-in test</li>
  <li>JUnit RAP test</li>
  <li>TestNG test</li>
  <li>Equinox OSGi framework (Eclipse &gt;3.2)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
  After your application or unit test has terminated code coverage information
  is automatically available in the Eclipse workbench:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage overview:</b> The <i>Coverage</i> view lists coverage
  summaries for your Java projects, allowing drill-down to method level.</li>
  
  <li><b>Source highlighting:</b> The result of a coverage session is also 
  directly visible in the Java source editors. A customizable color code
  highlights fully, partly and not covered lines. This works for your own source
  code as well as for source attached to instrumented external libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additional features support analysis for your test coverage:
</p>

<ul>  
  <li><b>Different counters:</b> Select whether instructions, lines, basic
  blocks, methods or loaded types should be summarized.</li>
  <li><b>Multiple coverage sessions:</b> Switching between coverage data from
  multiple sessions is possible.</li>
  <li><b>Merge Sessions:</b> If multiple different test runs
  should be considered for analysis coverage sessions can easily be merged.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Import/Export</h3>

<p>
  While EclEmma is primarily designed for test runs and analysis within the
  Eclipse workbench, it provides some import/export features.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage data import:</b> A wizard allows to import
  <code>*.ec</code> coverage data files from external launches.</li>
  <li><b>Coverage report export:</b> Coverage data can be
  exported as HTML, XML or plain text files or as EMMA session file
  (<code>*.ec</code>).</li>
</ul>

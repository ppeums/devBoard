<h2>Using the Coverage View</h2>

<p>
  The <i>Coverage</i> view automatically appears when a new
  <a href="sessions.html">coverage session</a> is
  added or can manually opened from the <em>Window &rarr; Show View</em> menu
  in the <em>Java</em> category. It shows coverage summaries for the active
  session.
</p>

</p>

<p>  
  The <i>Coverage</i> view shows all instrumented Java elements within the
  common Java hierarchy. Individual columns contain the following numbers for
  the active session, always summarizing the child elements of the respective
  Java element:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coverage ration</li>
  <li>Items covered</li>
  <li>Items not covered</li>
  <li>Total items</li>
</ul>
  
<p>
  The elements may be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking the
  respective column header. Double-clicking an element opens its declaration in
  an editor with <a href="annotations.html">highlighted</a> source code. You can
  select between different metrics, see last section for details.
</p>

<h3>Toolbar and Drop-Down Menu</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  The coverage view's toolbar offers the following actions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coverage Last Launched</b>: Re-run the currently selected coverage
  session.</li>
  <li><b>Remove Active Session</b>: Remove the currently selected coverage
  session.</li>
  <li><b>Remove All Sessions</b>: Remove all coverage sessions.</li>
  <li><b>Merge Sessions</b>: Merges multiple sessions into a single one.</li>
  <li><b>Select Session</b>: Select <a href="sessions.html">session</a> from the
  drop down-menu and make it the active session.</li>
  <li><b>Collapse All</b>: Collapse all expanded tree nodes.</li>
  <li><b>Link with Current Selection</b>: If this toggle is checked the coverage
  view automatically reveals the Java element currently selected in other views
  or editors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some of the actions are deactivated if there is no session or only a single
  session. More settings are available form the coverage view's drop-down menu:

</p>
  
<ul>  
  <li><b>Show Elements</b>: Select Java elements shown as root entries
  in the coverage tree: Projects, package fragment roots (source folders or
  libraries), package fragments or types.</li>
  <li><b>Counter Mode</b>: Different counter modes can be selected from the
  view's drop-down menu: bytecode instructions, basic blocks, lines, methods
  and types. See next sections for details.</li>  
  <li><b>Hide Unused Types</b>: Filter all Java types from the coverage view
  that has not been loaded during the coverage session.</li>  
</ul>

<h3>Counters</h3>

<p>
  When analyzing the coverage data collected during a coverage session different
  counters are evaluated for each Java element. The <i>coverage
  view</i> allows to select from its drop-down menu which counter should be
  displayed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Basic Blocks:</b> This is EMMA's fundamental unit of coverage. A basic
  block is a sequence of bytecode instructions without any jumps or jump
  targets. A basic block is considered as covered when its last instruction has
  been executed.</li>
  <li><b>Lines:</b> The number of covered Java source code lines. A source line
  is considered as covered if it contains at least one covered basic block. This
  counter is only available if the line numbers are included in the compiled
  class files (debug mode).</li>
  <li><b>Bytecode Instructions:</b> The number of bytecode instructions within
  the basic blocks. If no line information is available this is a good
  approximation for line coverage.</li>
  <li><b>Methods:</b> A method is considered as covered if at least one basic
  block of the method has been executed.</li>
  <li><b>Types:</b> A Java type is considered as covered if it has been loaded
  and initialized.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Filtering</h3>

<p>
  If you're working on a particular unit you can filter out all classes which
  have not been loaded during the test run. This filtering can be enabled with
  the <i>Hide Unused Types</i> menu entry in the <i>Coverage</i> view's
  drop-down menu.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Tip:</b> Combine the <i>Hide Unused Types</i> option with types as root
  entries. This will give you a plain list of all classes loaded for your test
  case.

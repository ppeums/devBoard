	An elegant "solution" to the rendering of MS Excel reports from
	a database is provided.  It is conjectured (see
	"Software Component Conjecture" of related article) that
	no easy drop-in web report solution exists due to the wide
	and enormous variation in web architectures.  Therefor, it is
	is indented that this solution be modified "leveraged" into a
	web solution.  Some possible necessary variation could be:

	o	Alternate database and datasource technologies.
	o	Rearrangement of pipeline URI's.
	o	Usage of XML database such as Xindices.
	o	Use of Web Messages Services (i.e. SOAP) instead of
			a local database.
	o	Addition of Query components in the parameter pipeline
			in order to obtain enumerated list from a database.


	The report author will need to be concerned with two
	components:

	o	An MS Excel template document in which all the report
		static content is placed.

	o	A "Report Scheme" XML document in which all data directive
		content is place.


	The key element contained in a report scheme file are:

	o		Report Title
	o		Report Description
	o		Request Parameters
	o		Data Query Statement, typically SQL
	o		Data Insertion directions

	The XML namespace is: "cocoon.clsw.com/report" with
	typical abbreviation of "rpt."


	The element tags and their semantic interpretation are:

	<rpt:report>					The root tag for all report format files.

		<rpt:title>					A simple string, potentially with special
												characters, for displaying the report title.

		<rpt:description> 	A text description of the report.

		<rpt:parameters>		Necessary parameters to execute the report
												are specified in this section.  Such parameters
												can be the date, customer name, etc...

  		<rpt:input-date>	A calendar date input parameter is requested

  			<rpt:title>			The text appearing next to the input parameter

  			<rpt:label>			The label associated with the HTTP submission

  			<rpt:init>			The initial default value

		<rpt:data-blocks>		A collection of individual data blocks

			<rpt:data-block>	A single data block.  Contains ONE query
												and one or more formatting statements.

				<rpt:column>		Format data as a column in MS-Excel

					<rpt:qry-name>	This is the column name of the data found in
													SQL Transformer results

					<rpt:adrs-column>	Column in MS-Excel: i.e. A,B,C...

					<rpt:adrs-row>		Beginning row in MS-Excel

					<rpt:type>				Data type to be use.  java.lang.String is
														default.  java.util.Double and java.util.Data
														are available choices.

				<rpt:row-copy-shift>	Shift all rows below that specified below DOWN
															by the number of rowsets retrieved by the SQL
															query statement.  This is use so that an unknown
															amount of data can be inserted into the report
															without overwriting anything: i.e. existing
															data can be shifted down and out of the way.

					<rpt:adrs-row>			Row to begin shift down activities.

					<rpt:adrs-column>		This specified edge of actives.

				<rpt:col-copy-shift>
					<rpt:adrs-column>
					<rpt:adrs-row>

				<rpt:row>
					<rpt:qry-name>
					<rpt:adrs-column>
					<rpt:adrs-row>
					<rpt:type>

				<rpt:matrix>
					<rpt:qry-name>
					<rpt:adrs-column>
					<rpt:adrs-row>
					<rpt:type>
